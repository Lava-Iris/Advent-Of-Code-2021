# Advent-Of-Code-2021

Hello!
This is my attempt for Advent Of Code 2021. 

I am a newbie coder and have just started to learn coding. The only language I know is JavaScript and even that is mainly self taught. 
This is the first event I've taken part in so please be kind with your judgement.
Constructive criticism and better solutions are welcome.:)

P.S. this is also my first time using github, and I'm mostly just fumbling about.
I hope to do my best for this event and enjoy the process thoroughly :)
